# Stochastic_simulation_a2

This project was created to study the behaviour of different service time distributions and queueing systems on their speed of convergence and mean waiting times. All functions that run the simulations, plots and statistical tests are in run.py and the variables CUSTOMERS and RUNS dictate the amount of customers and runs the simulations will be simulated for. All functions actually running the code are found and documented in functions.py

This project was created by Arend Geerlofs, Mirjam Koedijk and Kevin Schaaf and will not be maintained after 04/12/2023
